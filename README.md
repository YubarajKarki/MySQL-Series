# SQL Practice with Alex's MySQL Series ðŸ“˜

## Project Overview
This repository documents my SQL learning journey, inspired by Alex Freberg's comprehensive MySQL series. Through these exercises, I have built a strong foundation in SQL, practicing essential commands, data manipulation, and querying techniques for effective data analysis.

## Topics Covered
- **Basic SQL Commands:** `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **Data Filtering & Sorting:** Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- **Aggregations & Grouping:** `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
- **Joins:** Inner, Outer, Left, Right, and Self Joins to combine data from multiple tables
- **Data Transformation:** Using `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and functions like `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `TRIM()`
- **Subqueries and Nested Queries**
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Simplifying complex queries for readability
- **Window Functions:** Exploring ranking and cumulative calculations

## Key Learnings
- Developed proficiency with SQL commands and data manipulation techniques.
- Gained confidence working with real-world datasets and optimizing query performance.
- Practiced building efficient and readable SQL queries for data analysis.
